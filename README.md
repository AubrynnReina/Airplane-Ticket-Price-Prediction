# Airplane-Ticket-Price-Prediction

This is an assignment for my data mining class. It is mostly about recognizing flawed data and handling them, the prediction model is an icing on the cake. Although, if I were to improve this project, I would consider some geographical data into the flights, which would maybe yield the distance of each flights, or rather, the distances of the flights (this can call for a sequential model).
